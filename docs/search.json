Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care.\nCross-referencing research with our data to identify potential factors (most must be created using given variables):\n\nCommunity poverty level\nPercentage of community that belongs to minority racial status\nPercent of single-family

One salient learning objective of the program is to instill passion and knowledge for remedying injustices in our nation’s educational institutions. In this project, we seek to carry forward what we have learned in our FOCUS and, through critical thinking, novel understandings of data visualization, and empathy, highlight discrepancies in academic achievement. Specifically, we will narrow in on elementary school students across the United States, identifying environmental factors that contribute to inequities in their education. \nGoals:\nParticularly, the goals of our project are to 1) illustrate the relative average 4th-grade reading level in each state; 2) provide a side-by-side comparison of how much funding each state is allocating towards students relative to each other; 3) utilize predictor pruning methods to construct a linear regression model with community-level factors that are associated with the average 4th-grade reading level across the county; and 4) determine the distribution of adults across various occupational fields in states with the best and worst 4th-grade reading levels. Each goal corresponds to a visualization or regression model. \nData Overview:\nTo achieve objectives, we integrated data from five datasets. The first dataset was scores, which had 6 variables and 54 observations. The variables of interest were state_name and reading_level, the average 4th-grade reading level in each given state in 2022 (state-wide achievement level). The second was childcare_costs, which had 61 variables and 34567 observations. childcare_costs offered all of our data on county-level socioeconomic factors, and we mutated various variables to be potential predictors in our linear regression model for goal #3. The counties dataset had 4 variables and 3144 observations and was used to merge the country-based data in childcare_costs with the state-based data in scores. The expenditures dataset had 6 variables and 23460 observations. From this dataset, we were interested in examining inf_adj_perchild, total government spending on educational resources per child adjusted for inflation. Our last dataset, us_states, there are 6 variables and 15537 observations. This dataset provides the latitude and longitude coordinates in order to create the choropleth map base of the United States for visualizations #1 and #2.\nThe scores data are from 2022, while the childcare_costs and expenditures data are from 2018 and 2016, respectively. We thought this was acceptable in the context because it is realistic for there to be a years-long delay between changes in community funding and resources and subsequent academic improvements.\nFindings:\nVisualization #1 achieves goal #1 through a choropleth map, which is a map that leverages differences in shading to denote the average value of a variable in distinct geographic regions. We primarily employ the geom_polygon() tool to do so. The map illustrates that three states, Florida, Wyoming, and Massachusetts, stood out among the rest for having superior demonstrated 4th-grade reading levels. To zoom out from this superlative factoid, it is also the case that smaller northeastern and a few midwestern states have higher reading levels. It may seem arbitrary that these three states scored above the rest in terms of reading levels, especially considering the diverse areas of the United States in which each of them is situated. However, consideration of principles learned in the KISS class, Critical Race Theory in Education, proves otherwise. Research into the breakdown of Florida’s 4th grade reading levels reveals one interesting notion: White students demonstrated consistently high reading levels, second only to Asian students (who make up a significant minority of the elementary population), whereas their other non-White counterparts scored lower, on average (“The Nation’s…”). Considering prior knowledge, the makeup of smaller northeastern states like Massachusetts or New Jersey and midwestern states like Wyoming or Colorado is also noteworthily White. Discussions in CRT have revealed the unfortunate truth that America’s education systems are upheld to be conducive to White students. According to the class-provided article “School Norms and Reforms, Critical Race Theory, and the Fairytale of Equitable Education,” white students excel on aptitude assessments like the SAT or IQ tests because they have been designed for them to do so. So, while there may be noteworthy additional circumstances that foretell academic success, as we begin analyzing predictors of achievement, it is important to first recognize race’s interplay with soon-to-be considered factors in propelling a certain demographic forward within American school systems. \nVisualization #2 fulfills goal #2 through another choropleth map. This time, each state is shaded based on its inf_adj_perchild. A side-by-side comparison of visualization #1 and #2 allows for preliminary conclusions on the impact of public investments into youth education and enables us to start identifying states that may have particularly cost-effective educational systems. New York, New Jersey, and Wyoming come forward as the states with the highest government spending on students. This has broad ties to visualization #1 where New Jersey and Wyoming were both in the top 5 of states in terms of reading_level. Notably, New York was ranked as state #37 in terms of reading_level, raising questions worth exploring in future research about how New York is investing in public education.\nOur final_model addresses goal #3. A foundational literature review implicates several social, psychological, and economic in the development of reading skills in elementary schoolers. Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and sincerely warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care. We cross-reference these findings with our data to create a number of variables of interest. We constructed family_poverty, which was renamed from pr_f and gives the poverty rate in the given county and minority_racial_status, which is the percent of the county population that identifies as one minority racial identity or as biracial. We also developed percentage_single_mother, which is the number of households with single mothers, divided by the total number of households. We designed another variable for the ratio of households with one working parent to two working parents: ratio_of_one_to_both. By simply renaming, we created average_center_child_care and average_family_child_care, the average cost of center-based and family-based child care, respectively, in the given county. We first engineered a maximum additive regression model with all the possible predictors, and then, we manually performed forward selection to determine what combination of the predictors yielded a model with the lowest adjusted R2. The models were sorted based on adjusted-R2. We created a data frame with all of the models and their corresponding adjusted R2 values. We then filtered for the model with the maximum R2. We find that regression_model_61 has the best fit and it includes the predictors family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households.\nVisualization #3 is rooted in goal #4. We have always been committed to creating a visualization that zooms in on states with the highest values in reading_level. In our literature review to determine potential community-level predictors for reading_level, we found that both socioeconomic status and parental attitudes contribute to reading_level, both of which may be reflect in parents’ occupations. Thus, we opted to explore the average distribution of occupational fields of adults across all the counties in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Wyoming, the states with the highest reading_level scores with inputted data for occupational percentages in childcare_costs in 2018— the most recent year of data collection. The original dataset included each occupational field as a separate variable and gave the percentage of adults who worked in that field for each county. We then pivoted the data so that each there was one variable for the names of the occupational fields, sector_type, and the associated percentage in each occupational field, sector_percentage. This enabled us to construct a bar graph that depicted the average percentage of the population that worked in each sector in each state. We find that in all four states of highest reading_level, the highest percentage of the population was employed in “Management and Science.” To go about explaining the distribution represented in this visualization, we drew upon the skill developed in the Rethinking Schools class: self-reflection. As we each examined the industries present in our hometowns, it becomes clear why there is a correlation between higher achievement and a high management and science makeup. In Noah’s hometown of Fairfax, Virginia, there is a large presence of government consulting firms and technology startups. He recalls how the confluence of these industries catalyzed his school district to become among the largest in the nation and found a magnet STEM school, Thomas Jefferson HS, now ranked the fifth best high school in the nation. Another testament to this notion is how Anushka, being from Westchester, New York, grew up surrounded by leaders of finance, medicine, and technology companies–no doubt making her school district (the 13th best in the country) what it is. Reflecting on some of our personal upbringings ultimately speaks to the data-driven fact that high achievement is associated with specific industry, making this visualization both personally and mathematically impactful.\nConclusion:\nOverall, our conclusions illuminate opportunities for political and programmatic interventions. Visualization #1 identifies the states with the highest scores in 4th-grade reading to be Massachusetts, Florida, and Wyoming. We subsequently determine that White students are overrepresented in these best-practice states. There is then a need to ensure that school’s do not exclusively appeal to the intellectual and social tendencies associated with Whiteness. Future research should be conducted to test the efficacy and feasibility of nascent frameworks for multicultural education. Visualization #2 finds that New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming have the highest expenditures on students. More specific work needs to be done on the associations between inf_adj_perchild and reading_level. Visualization #3 finds that family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households all play a significant role in children’s educational experiences. Immediately, this analysis supports the continued development of public policies that encourage maternity and/or paternity leave as well as fund subsidized childcare programs. Furthermore, we affirm an already robust understanding of the poverty cycle; low educational achievement associated with high poverty levels will make it tough for children from low-income neighborhoods to reach economic prosperity. Visualization #4 suggests that states with high reading_level also have a high percentage of adults who work in “Management and Science,” fostering ideas about novel programs that create government-sponsored vocational training for adults from all communities to enter competitive fields.\nOur analyses were restricted in a number of ways. First, since we only had the average 4th-grade reading_level per state, we were not able to take comprehensive advantage of the detailed data at the county level. We could only look at the heterogeneity between states rather than the heterogeneity within states as well. Also, we could not examine longitudinal trends; we only had scores from 2022, so we opted to use community data from 2018, the most recent year of inputted data in childcare_costs, thus producing an arbitrary inference concerning time-delay. Moreover, in the field of childhood education, standardized tests have persistently been delegitimized as they are not truly baseline ways to measure aptitude, potential, and achievement when other confounding variables such as disability or neurodiversity exist as we learned in our other FOCUS classes. In light of these limitations, future research should determine predictors of academic success at the county level, which will facilitate more specific conclusions and data points that can be used in the training of regression models. Additionally, interactive visualizations can be pioneered to represent changes in reading_level and corresponding predictors over time. Research effort should also be made to replicate these analyses but with a more holistic outcome measure, such as overall classroom functioning as reported by teachers."

Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care.\nCross-referencing research with our

One salient learning objective of the program is to instill passion and knowledge for remedying injustices in our nation’s educational institutions. In this project, we seek to carry forward what we have learned in our FOCUS and, through critical thinking, novel understandings of data visualization, and empathy, highlight discrepancies in academic achievement. Specifically, we will narrow in on elementary school students across the United States, identifying environmental factors that contribute to inequities in their education. \nGoals:\nParticularly, the goals of our project are to 1) illustrate the relative average 4th-grade reading level in each state; 2) provide a side-by-side comparison of how much funding each state is allocating towards students relative to each other; 3) utilize predictor pruning methods to construct a linear regression model with community-level factors that are associated with the average 4th-grade reading level across the county; and 4) determine the distribution of adults across various occupational fields in states with the best 4th-grade reading levels. Each goal corresponds to a visualization or regression model. \nData Overview:\nTo achieve objectives, we integrated data from four datasets. The first dataset was scores, which had 6 variables and 54 observations. The variables of interest were state_name, and reading_level, the average 4th-grade reading level in the given state in 2022 (state-wide achievement level). The second was childcare_costs, which had 61 variables and 34567 observations. Childcare_costs offered all of our data on county-level socioeconomic factors, and we mutated various variables to be potential predictors in our linear regression model for goal #3. The counties dataset had 4 variables and 3144 observations and was used to merge the country-based data in childcare_costs with the state-based data in scores. The expenditures dataset had 6 variables and 23460 observations. From this dataset, we were interested in examining inf_adj_perchild, or total government spending on educational resources per child adjusted for inflation. \nThe scores data are from 2022, while the childcare_costs and expenditures data are from 2018 and 2016, respectively. We thought this was acceptable in the context because it is realistic for there to be a years-long delay between changes in community funding and resources and subsequent academic improvements.\nFindings:\nVisualization #1 achieves goal #1 through a choropleth map, which is a map that leverages differences in shading to denote the average value of a variable in distinct geographic regions. We primarily employ the geom_polygon() tool to do so. The map illustrates that three states, Florida, Wyoming, and Massachusetts, stood out among the rest for having superior demonstrated 4th-grade reading levels. To zoom out from this superlative factoid, it is also the case that smaller northeastern and a few midwestern states have higher reading levels It may seem arbitrary that these three states scored above the rest in terms of reading levels, especially considering the diverse areas of the United States in which each of them is situated. However, consideration of principles learned in the KISS class, Critical Race Theory in Education, proves otherwise. Research into the breakdown of Florida’s 4th grade reading levels reveals one interesting notion: White students demonstrated consistently high reading levels, second only to Asian students (who make up a significant minority of the elementary population), whereas their other non-White counterparts scored lower, on average (“The Nation’s…”). Considering prior knowledge, the makeup of smaller northeastern states like Massachusetts or New Jersey and midwestern states like Wyoming or Colorado is also noteworthily White. Discussions in CRT have revealed the unfortunate truth that America’s education systems are upheld to be conducive to White students. According to the class-provided article “School Norms and Reforms, Critical Race Theory, and the Fairytale of Equitable Education,” White students excel on aptitude assessments like the SAT or IQ tests because they have been designed for them to do so. So, while there may be noteworthy additional circumstances that foretell academic success, as we begin analyzing predictors of achievement, it is important to first recognize race’s interplay with soon-to-be considered factors in propelling a certain demographic forward within American school systems. \nVisualization #2 fulfills goal #2 through another choropleth map. This time, each state is shaded based on its inf_adj_perchild. A side-by-side comparison of visualization #1 and #2 allows for preliminary conclusions on the impact of public investments into youth education and enables us to start identifying states that may have particularly cost-effective educational systems. New York, New Jersey, and Wyoming come forward as the states with the highest government spending on students. This has broad ties to visualization #1 where New Jersey and Wyoming were both in the top 5 of states in terms of reading_level. Notably, New York was ranked as state #37 in terms of reading_level, raising questions worth exploring in future research about how New York is investing in public education.\nOur final_model addresses goal #3. A foundational literature review implicates several social, psychological, and economic in the development of reading skills in elementary schoolers. Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and sincerely warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care. We cross-reference these findings with our data to create a number of variables of interest. We constructed family_poverty, which was renamed from pr_f and gives the poverty rate in the given county and minority_racial_status, which is the percent of the county population that identifies as one minority racial identity or as biracial. We also developed percentage_single_mother, which is the number of households with single mothers, divided by the total number of households. We designed another variable for the ratio of households with one working parent to two working parents: ratio_of_one_to_both. By simply renaming, we created average_center_child_care and average_family_child_care, the average cost of center-based and family-based child care, respectively, in the given county. We first engineered a maximum additive regression model with all the possible predictors, and then, we manually performed forward selection to determine what combination of the predictors yielded a model with the lowest adjusted R2. The models were sorted based on adjusted-R2. We created a data frame with all of the models and their corresponding adjusted R2 values. We then filtered for the model with the maximum R2. We find that regression_model_61 has the best fit and it includes the predictors family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households.\nVisualization #4 is rooted in goal #4. We have always been committed to creating a visualization that zooms in on states with the highest values in reading_level. In our literature review to determine potential community-level predictors for reading_level, we found that both socioeconomic status and parental attitudes contribute to reading_level, both of which may be reflect in parents’ occupations. Thus, we opted to explore the average distribution of occupational fields of adults across all the counties in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Wyoming, the states with the highest reading_level scores with inputted data for occupational percentages in childcare_costs in 2018— the most recent year of data collection. The original dataset included each occupational field as a separate variable and gave the percentage of adults who worked in that field for each county. We then pivoted the data so that each there was one variable for the names of the occupational fields, sector_type, and the associated percentage in each occupational field, sector_percentage. This enabled us to construct a bar graph that depicted the average percentage of the population that worked in each sector in each state. We find that in all four states of highest reading_level, the highest percentage of the population was employed in “Management and Science.” To go about explaining the distribution represented in this visualization, we drew upon the skill developed in the Rethinking Schools class: self-reflection. As we each examined the industries present in our hometowns, it becomes clear why there is a correlation between higher achievement and a high management and science makeup. In Noah’s hometown of Fairfax, Virginia, there is a large presence of government consulting firms and technology startups. He recalls how the confluence of these industries catalyzed his school district to become among the largest in the nation and found a magnet STEM school, Thomas Jefferson HS, now ranked the fifth best high school in the nation. Another testament to this notion is how Anushka, being from Westchester, New York, grew up surrounded by leaders of finance, medicine, and technology companies–no doubt making her school district (the 13th best in the country) what it is. Reflecting on some of our personal upbringings ultimately speaks to the data-driven fact that high achievement is associated with specific industry, making this visualization both personally and mathematically impactful.\nConclusion:\nOverall, our conclusions illuminate opportunities for political and programmatic interventions. Visualization #1 identifies the states with the highest scores in 4th-grade reading to be Massachusetts, Florida, and Wyoming. We subsequently determine that White students are overrepresented in these best-practice states. There is then a need to ensure that school’s do not exclusively appeal to the intellectual and social tendencies associated with Whiteness. Future research should be conducted to test the efficacy and feasibility of nascent frameworks for multicultural education. Visualization #2 finds that New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming have the highest expenditures on students. More specific work needs to be done on the associations between inf_adj_perchild and reading_level. Visualization #3 finds that family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households all play a significant role in children’s educational experiences. Immediately, this analysis supports the continued development of public policies that encourage maternity and/or paternity leave as well as fund subsidized childcare programs. Furthermore, we affirm an already robust understanding of the poverty cycle; low educational achievement associated with high poverty levels will make it tough for children from low-income neighborhoods to reach economic prosperity. Visualization #4 suggests that states with high reading_level also have a high percentage of adults who work in “Management and Science,” fostering ideas about novel programs that create government-sponsored vocational training for adults from all communities to enter competitive fields.\nOur analyses were restricted in a number of ways. First, since we only had the average 4th-grade reading_level per state, we were not able to take comprehensive advantage of the detailed data at the county level. We could only look at the heterogeneity between states rather than the heterogeneity within states as well. Also, we could not examine longitudinal trends; we only had scores from 2022, so we opted to use community data from 2018, the most recent year of inputted data in childcare_costs, thus producing an arbitrary inference concerning time-delay. Moreover, in the field of childhood education, standardized tests have persistently been delegitimized as they are not truly baseline ways to measure aptitude, potential, and achievement when other confounding variables such as disability or neurodiversity exist as we learned in our other FOCUS classes. In light of these limitations, future research should determine predictors of academic success at the county level, which will facilitate more specific conclusions and data points that can be used in the training of regression models. Additionally, interactive visualizations can be pioneered to represent changes in reading_level and corresponding predictors over time. Research effort should also be made to replicate these analyses but with a more holistic outcome measure, such as overall classroom functioning as reported by teachers."

Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care.\nCross-referencing research with our data to identify potential factors (most must be created using given variables):\n\nCommunity poverty level\nPercentage of community that belongs to minority racial status\nPercent of single-family

One salient learning objective of the program is to instill passion and knowledge for remedying injustices in our nation’s educational institutions. In this project, we seek to carry forward what we have learned in our FOCUS and, through critical thinking, novel understandings of data visualization, and empathy, highlight discrepancies in academic achievement. Specifically, we will narrow in on elementary school students across the United States, identifying environmental factors that contribute to inequities in their education. \nGoals:\nParticularly, the goals of our project are to 1) illustrate the relative average 4th-grade reading level in each state; 2) provide a side-by-side comparison of how much funding each state is allocating towards students relative to each other; 3) utilize predictor pruning methods to construct a linear regression model with community-level factors that are associated with the average 4th-grade reading level across the county; and 4) determine the distribution of adults across various occupational fields in states with the best 4th-grade reading levels. Each goal corresponds to a visualization or regression model. \nData Overview:\nTo achieve objectives, we integrated data from four datasets. The first dataset was scores, which had 6 variables and 54 observations. The variables of interest were state_name, and reading_level, the average 4th-grade reading level in the given state in 2022 (state-wide achievement level). The second was childcare_costs, which had 61 variables and 34567 observations. Childcare_costs offered all of our data on county-level socioeconomic factors, and we mutated various variables to be potential predictors in our linear regression model for goal #3. The counties dataset had 4 variables and 3144 observations and was used to merge the country-based data in childcare_costs with the state-based data in scores. The expenditures dataset had 6 variables and 23460 observations. From this dataset, we were interested in examining inf_adj_perchild, or total government spending on educational resources per child adjusted for inflation. \nThe scores data are from 2022, while the childcare_costs and expenditures data are from 2018 and 2016, respectively. We thought this was acceptable in the context because it is realistic for there to be a years-long delay between changes in community funding and resources and subsequent academic improvements.\nFindings:\nVisualization #1 achieves goal #1 through a choropleth map, which is a map that leverages differences in shading to denote the average value of a variable in distinct geographic regions. We primarily employ the geom_polygon() tool to do so. The map illustrates that three states, Florida, Wyoming, and Massachusetts, stood out among the rest for having superior demonstrated 4th-grade reading levels. To zoom out from this superlative factoid, it is also the case that smaller northeastern and a few midwestern states have higher reading levels It may seem arbitrary that these three states scored above the rest in terms of reading levels, especially considering the diverse areas of the United States in which each of them is situated. However, consideration of principles learned in the KISS class, Critical Race Theory in Education, proves otherwise. Research into the breakdown of Florida’s 4th grade reading levels reveals one interesting notion: White students demonstrated consistently high reading levels, second only to Asian students (who make up a significant minority of the elementary population), whereas their other non-White counterparts scored lower, on average (“The Nation’s…”). Considering prior knowledge, the makeup of smaller northeastern states like Massachusetts or New Jersey and midwestern states like Wyoming or Colorado is also noteworthily White. Discussions in CRT have revealed the unfortunate truth that America’s education systems are upheld to be conducive to White students. According to the class-provided article “School Norms and Reforms, Critical Race Theory, and the Fairytale of Equitable Education,” White students excel on aptitude assessments like the SAT or IQ tests because they have been designed for them to do so. So, while there may be noteworthy additional circumstances that foretell academic success, as we begin analyzing predictors of achievement, it is important to first recognize race’s interplay with soon-to-be considered factors in propelling a certain demographic forward within American school systems. \nVisualization #2 fulfills goal #2 through another choropleth map. This time, each state is shaded based on its inf_adj_perchild. A side-by-side comparison of visualization #1 and #2 allows for preliminary conclusions on the impact of public investments into youth education and enables us to start identifying states that may have particularly cost-effective educational systems. New York, New Jersey, and Wyoming come forward as the states with the highest government spending on students. This has broad ties to visualization #1 where New Jersey and Wyoming were both in the top 5 of states in terms of reading_level. Notably, New York was ranked as state #37 in terms of reading_level, raising questions worth exploring in future research about how New York is investing in public education.\nOur final_model addresses goal #3. A foundational literature review implicates several social, psychological, and economic in the development of reading skills in elementary schoolers. Socioeconomic status has been consistently shown to influence academic success, specifically due to differing access to books, supportive services, and qualified teachers as well as due to exposure to adversity and parental distress. The structural connections between race, socioecnomic status, and long-term outcomes makes racial minority status another potential variable of interest. Along with socioeconomic status, parents’ capacity to be highly engaged and sincerely warm affects psychological health, which often underpins academic trajectories. Thus, we seek to examine whether having both, one, or no working parents affects reading skills. Finally, it is necessary to explore the role of access to both family-based and center-based child care given the proven significance of high-quality child care. We cross-reference these findings with our data to create a number of variables of interest. We constructed family_poverty, which was renamed from pr_f and gives the poverty rate in the given county and minority_racial_status, which is the percent of the county population that identifies as one minority racial identity or as biracial. We also developed percentage_single_mother, which is the number of households with single mothers, divided by the total number of households. We designed another variable for the ratio of households with one working parent to two working parents: ratio_of_one_to_both. By simply renaming, we created average_center_child_care and average_family_child_care, the average cost of center-based and family-based child care, respectively, in the given county. We first engineered a maximum additive regression model with all the possible predictors, and then, we manually performed forward selection to determine what combination of the predictors yielded a model with the lowest adjusted R2. The models were sorted based on adjusted-R2. We created a data frame with all of the models and their corresponding adjusted R2 values. We then filtered for the model with the maximum R2. We find that regression_model_61 has the best fit and it includes the predictors family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households.\nVisualization #3 is rooted in goal #4. We have always been committed to creating a visualization that zooms in on states with the highest values in reading_level. In our literature review to determine potential community-level predictors for reading_level, we found that both socioeconomic status and parental attitudes contribute to reading_level, both of which may be reflect in parents’ occupations. Thus, we opted to explore the average distribution of occupational fields of adults across all the counties in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Wyoming, the states with the highest reading_level scores with inputted data for occupational percentages in childcare_costs in 2018— the most recent year of data collection. The original dataset included each occupational field as a separate variable and gave the percentage of adults who worked in that field for each county. We then pivoted the data so that each there was one variable for the names of the occupational fields, sector_type, and the associated percentage in each occupational field, sector_percentage. This enabled us to construct a bar graph that depicted the average percentage of the population that worked in each sector in each state. We find that in all four states of highest reading_level, the highest percentage of the population was employed in “Management and Science.” To go about explaining the distribution represented in this visualization, we drew upon the skill developed in the Rethinking Schools class: self-reflection. As we each examined the industries present in our hometowns, it becomes clear why there is a correlation between higher achievement and a high management and science makeup. In Noah’s hometown of Fairfax, Virginia, there is a large presence of government consulting firms and technology startups. He recalls how the confluence of these industries catalyzed his school district to become among the largest in the nation and found a magnet STEM school, Thomas Jefferson HS, now ranked the fifth best high school in the nation. Another testament to this notion is how Anushka, being from Westchester, New York, grew up surrounded by leaders of finance, medicine, and technology companies–no doubt making her school district (the 13th best in the country) what it is. Reflecting on some of our personal upbringings ultimately speaks to the data-driven fact that high achievement is associated with specific industry, making this visualization both personally and mathematically impactful.\nConclusion:\nOverall, our conclusions illuminate opportunities for political and programmatic interventions. Visualization #1 identifies the states with the highest scores in 4th-grade reading to be Massachusetts, Florida, and Wyoming. We subsequently determine that White students are overrepresented in these best-practice states. There is then a need to ensure that school’s do not exclusively appeal to the intellectual and social tendencies associated with Whiteness. Future research should be conducted to test the efficacy and feasibility of nascent frameworks for multicultural education. Visualization #2 finds that New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming have the highest expenditures on students. More specific work needs to be done on the associations between inf_adj_perchild and reading_level. Visualization #3 finds that family_poverty , ratio_of_one_to_both, average_center_child_care, average_family_child_care, and one_parent_households all play a significant role in children’s educational experiences. Immediately, this analysis supports the continued development of public policies that encourage maternity and/or paternity leave as well as fund subsidized childcare programs. Furthermore, we affirm an already robust understanding of the poverty cycle; low educational achievement associated with high poverty levels will make it tough for children from low-income neighborhoods to reach economic prosperity. Visualization #3 suggests that states with high reading_level also have a high percentage of adults who work in “Management and Science,” fostering ideas about novel programs that create government-sponsored vocational training for adults from all communities to enter competitive fields.\nOur analyses were restricted in a number of ways. First, since we only had the average 4th-grade reading_level per state, we were not able to take comprehensive advantage of the detailed data at the county level. We could only look at the heterogeneity between states rather than the heterogeneity within states as well. Also, we could not examine longitudinal trends; we only had scores from 2022, so we opted to use community data from 2018, the most recent year of inputted data in childcare_costs, thus producing an arbitrary inference concerning time-delay. Moreover, in the field of childhood education, standardized tests have persistently been delegitimized as they are not truly baseline ways to measure aptitude, potential, and achievement when other confounding variables such as disability or neurodiversity exist as we learned in our other FOCUS classes. In light of these limitations, future research should determine predictors of academic success at the county level, which will facilitate more specific conclusions and data points that can be used in the training of regression models. Additionally, interactive visualizations can be pioneered to represent changes in reading_level and corresponding predictors over time. Research effort should also be made to replicate these analyses but with a more holistic outcome measure, such as overall classroom functioning as reported by teachers."
