"Notes"
"Data are state reported, reflect spending during State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2021, and may not sum to totals due to rounding."
""
"The data above reflect the distribution of state general fund and other state funds by different expenditure categories. While general funds are a significant source of state revenues to fund expenditures, other sources of state revenues are also used, reported in this data source as ""other state funds."" The distribution of state funding across expenditure categories from these sources of state funds (general fund and other state funds) can vary depending on how states have chosen to finance different expenditures (e.g. some states may rely more on other state funds such as lottery funds to finance state spending on K-12 education or provider taxes, fees and donations to fund Medicaid expenditures.) States also differ in which functions are state or local responsibilities; this can also lead to variation across states in the distribution of state funds across expenditure categories. For additional information and state-specific notes, please see data source."

""
"*Higher Education*: States were requested to include expenditures made for capital construction, community colleges, vocational education, law, medical, veterinary, nursing and technical schools, and assistance to private colleges and universities, as well as tuition, fees and student loan programs. Higher education expenditures exclude federal research grants and endowments to universities."
""
"*Public Assistance*: Includes expenditures for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and other cash assistance (i.e., state supplements to the Supplemental Security Income program, general or emergency assistance). States were asked to exclude administrative costs from reported expenditures."
""
"*Medicaid*: Excludes administrative costs, but includes spending from state funds, federal matching funds and other funds and revenue sources used as a Medicaid match such as provider taxes, fees, assessments, donations, and local funds. Medicare Part D clawback payments are included in a state’s overall Medicaid expenditures. "
""

""

The exceptions are as follows: in New York, the fiscal year begins on April 1; in Texas, the fiscal year begins on September 1; and in Alabama and Michigan the fiscal year begins on October 1. The length of budget cycles vary among states, with more than half of the states budgeting annually and the remainder enacting biennial budgets. "
