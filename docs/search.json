    "text": "In this project, we seek to identify both community-level sociodemographic factors and state-level funding factors that predict statewide fourth-grade achievement rates in reading. Our ultimate goal is to determine pathways for policy-based intervention in the future to maximize educational success for youth of all backgrounds. We came upon this topic as a result of the content we are learning in our FOCUS cluster, Knowledge in the Service of Society. We are seeking to go beyond identifying community-level inequities and instead hope to investigate root causes and their logical solutions. \nTo properly explore these factors, our project will include four major steps:\nFirst, we will teach ourselves how to use the maps package to create a choropleth map of the United States where a gradient scale demonstrates the state achievement rates in fourth grade reading. This visualization will allow us, and others, to easily identify the states with highest achievement rates. From here, we can conduct further analysis on the funding distributions and community-level variables in these “best-practice states.” \nSecond, we will make a second choropleth map (a map that overlays a color gradient across a geogprahic region to portray the level of another variable across locations) using the expenditures dataset. This visualization will serve as a comparison to the first one, providing a visual representation of total school expenditures in elementary schools by state. By creating two maps of the same area (the United States) and using gradient scales to indicate both funding levels and achievement scores, viewers will be able to easily draw their own conclusions about possible associations between the two factors. In later parts of our project, we will use models to come to objective standpoints. \nThird, we will use forward selection (a systematic process of adding variables to a multiple linear regression model and comparing R-squared values) to identify community-level factors (e.g. poverty rate, median household income, average cost of childcare) that accurately predict statewide fourth grade achievement rates in reading. We will select potential predictors based on background knowledge from our other FOCUS classes and then move to statistical methods (adjusted-R2) to assess their importance in this context. Ultimately, we will have a linear regression model that merges a collection of community-level socioeconomic variables to predict fourth grade reading levels. After identifying which sociodemographic changes impact education achievement, we will be able to later theorize over possible steps to progress towards overall improvement via these specific pathways.\nThe fourth goal we want to accomplish is largely based upon the initial visualizations we create. Using the choropleth map, regression model, and R-squared analysis, we will ideally identify one or two noteworthy variables that appear to be the best predictors of achievement in fourth graders. We will complete 1-3 of these three options based on initial findings.\n\nIf we see that total elementary school expenditures seems to predict achievement rate based on the choropleth map from goal #2, we will analytically confirm this relationship through linear regression. We will then use the mutate() function to see whether the relationship is maintained based on the percentage of total state funding that is spent in elementary schools or whether an association exclusively exists between the total amount of elementary school funding and achievement rates.\nBased on knowledge from our other KISS classes, we will explore the interactive effect between two significant community-level predictors of achievement rates to get a more granular understanding of how community structures combine with one another to predict academic success in youth.\nWe will determine a threshold for so-called “high achievement rates” and then subset our data to include states with achievement rates past this threshold. For these states, we will create bar charts that allow us to examine the distribution of funding in every sector within total state expenditures.\n\nWe will use these bar charts to determine which sectors (e.g. transportation, Medicaid, etc.) seem to be getting the greatest allocation of state funding in top achievement states and then use multiple linear regression to confirm our hypothesized associations between funding distribution and achievement outcomes."

We chose this dataset because we wanted to compare government spending by both state and sector, focusing on 2021 educational expenditure amounts and their effects upon 2022 achievement rates from the scores dataset. The expenditures dataset has 82 observations and 1 variables. The observations are separated by state (with the additions of the District of Columbia and a row for the United States average) and specify 8 different types of public spending per state: Elementary & Secondary Education, Medicaid, Transportation, and Higher Education, Public Assistance, Corrections. \nThe scores dataset is based on the Nation’s Report Card data that uses the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessments with scores from 0-500 in mathematics, reading, writing, and sciences at grade 4. This dataset compares state and jurisdiction performance to the national public average scale score of 216. We chose this dataset because we need a quantitative way to analyze educational progress within each state/jurisdiction. The scores dataset has 54 observations and 6 variables. The observations are separated by state (plus the Department of Defense Education Activity, National Public, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico). The dataset displays the average scores for each region (MN), the difference from the National Public (SigDiff), how significant the score is from the National Public (SigSymbol), the percentage at or above Basic (AB), and the percentage at or above Proficient (AP).\nThe childcare_costs dataset is from a federal source, the National Database of Childcare Prices. Measured from 2008 to 2018, its data is captured at the county level by for whom, what, where (, etc.) the childcare is provided. It also measures these data in conjunction with other seemingly unrelated variables and circumstances like teenage unemployment or young-parent labor. In the set, there are 34567 rows and 61 columns. This dataset seemed pertinent because of how deeply intertwined it is with both the basis and offshooting considerations of our project. For example, it ties childcare costs with race, location, gender, income, and more; tying these considerations in with achievement rates provides a comprehensive look at predictors for childhood success. It is our hope that this dataset provides breadth to the analyses we proceed with conducting."
